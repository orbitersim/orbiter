<h1>Hubble Space Telescope</h1>
<p>The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is the visible/ultraviolet/near-infrared
element of the Great Observatories astronomical program. The spacecraft
provides an order of magnitude better resolution than is capable from
ground-based telescopes.</p>
<p>During initial on-orbit checkout of the Hubble's systems, a
flaw in the telescope's main reflective mirror was found that prevented
perfect focus of the incoming light. This flaw was caused by the
incorrect adjustment of a testing device used in building the mirror.
Fortunately, however, Hubble was designed for regular on-orbit
maintenance by Shuttle missions. The first servicing mission, STS-61 in
December 1993, fully corrected the problem by installing a corrective
optics package and upgraded instruments (as well as replacing other
satellite components).</p>
<p>David Sundstrom's HST model shows off the grappling capabilities of Atlantis' manipulator arm.
The arm can be controlled via the control pad (Ctrl-Space).</p>
