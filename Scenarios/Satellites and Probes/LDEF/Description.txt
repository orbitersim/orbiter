<h1>Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF)</h1>
<p>The LDEF was a large orbital material research platform containing
multiple experiments to test the effect of the outer space environment on
electronic systems, materials and spore survival.</p>
<p>Deployed in orbit on April 7, 1984 by Shuttle Challenger and intended for
retrieval after one year, the LDEF satellite was stranded
in orbit for six years after the Challenger accident. The crew of STS-32
recovered the LDEF from its decaying orbit on January 11, 1990, two months
before it would have re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and would have been 
destroyed.</p>
