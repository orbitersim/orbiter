This folder contains the HTML source files and project files for the online
help system of the Orbiter Scenario Editor.

You need MS HTML Help Workshop installed on your computer to compile the
help system. (HTML Help Workshop can be downloaded free from the MS web site.)

Open the help project ScnEditor.hhp in the help compiler (hhc.exe) to modify
and compile the help system. The compiled ScnEditor.chm should be moved to
the Orbiter\Html\Plugin folder.
