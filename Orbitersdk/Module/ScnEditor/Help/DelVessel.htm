<h1>Deleting a vessel</h1>
<p>
Clicking the <i>Delete</i> button in the editor’s main page will delete the vessel that is selected in the vessel list. The input focus and camera will automatically switch to another vessel, if necessary.
<p>
You are not allowed to delete all vessels from the simulation: Orbiter requires at least one vessel that accepts control input to work properly (note that some vessels may have been designed not to receive the input focus.)
