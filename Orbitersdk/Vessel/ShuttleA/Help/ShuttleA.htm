<h1>Shuttle-A vessel class</h1>
<p>
<img src="ShuttleA.jpg" width=100%>
<p>Shuttle-A is an interplanetary cargo vessel. It has a versatile engine layout, including main and hover engines, and addotional auxiliary engine pods that can be rotated for thrust vectoring. It has poor aerodynamic characteristics, which can make it challenging to handle in atmospheric environments.</p>
<p>In addition to the default glass cockpit layout, the Shuttle-A supports custom 2-D panels and (rudimentary) virtual cockpit. Use F8 to switch between the cockpit modes. In addition to the main MFD instruments, the 2-D panel also features an ADI ball. Make sure to run the <i>Tutorials\ADI training</i> scenario for some ADI instruction.</p>
