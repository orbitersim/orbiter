<h1>Radiator Operation</h1>
<p>

The Space Shuttle has four radiators to dissipate heat from the coolant loops - two on the inside of each of the payload bay doors. The forward radiator panels on each side can be deployed when the doors are open; the aft panels are fixed.

The bay doors and radiators are operated by using the switches on  panel R13L. Note that the software interface for operating the doors is not currently simulated.

<h2>Radiator deployment sequence:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The payload bay doors must be fully open.
<li>Set the <i>PL BAY MECH PWR SYS 1</i> and <i>SYS 2</i> switches to ON.
<li>Set the <i>LATCH CONTROL SYS A</i> and <i>SYS B</i> switches to REL (release).
<li>After 30 seconds, set both latch control switches back to OFF.
<li>Set the <i>RADIATOR CONTROL SYS A</i> and <i>SYS B</i> switches to DEPLOY.
<li>After 50 seconds, set both radiator control switches back to OFF.
<li>Set both <i>PL BAY MECH PWR</i> switches back to OFF.
</ul>

<h2>Radiator stowing sequence:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Set the <i>PL BAY MECH PWR SYS 1</i> and <i>SYS 2</i>switches to ON.
<li>Set the <i>RADIATOR CONTROL SYS A</i> and <i>SYS B</i> switches to STOW.
<li>After 50 seconds, set both radiator control switches back to OFF.
<li>Set the <i>LATCH CONTROL SYS A</i> and <i>SYS B</i> switches to LATCH.
<li>After 30 seconds, set both latch control switches back to OFF.
<li>Set both <i>PL BAY MECH PWR</i> switches back to OFF.
</ul>
