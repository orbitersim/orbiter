<h1>Ku-Band Antenna Operation</h1>
<p>

The Ku-band antenna is carried on the starboard sill longeron inside the Orbiter's cargo bay and can be deployed once the payload bay doors are opened.
The antenna is used for communication with ground stations. Alternatively, it can also be used as a radar system for tracking objects in space.

The controls for deployment and stowage of the Ku-band system are located on panel R13L. Jettisoning the assembly, and the actual functionality of the Ku-band system are not currently implemented in this version.

<h2>Ku-band deployment sequence:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The payload bay doors must be fully open.
<li>Set the<i>KU ANTENNA</i> switch to DEPLOY.
<li>The deployment procedure takes approximately 23 seconds.
<li>When the talkback indicator shows "DPL", set the <i>KU ANTENNA</i> switch back to GND.
</ul>

<h2>Radiator stowing sequence:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Set the <i>KU ANTENNA</i> switch to STOW.
<li>The stowing procedure takes approximately 23 seconds.
<li>When the talkback indicator shows "STO", set the <i>KU ANTENNA</i> switch back to GND.
<li>If the assembly does not respond to the normal stowing operation, set the <i>KU ANTENNA DIRECT STOW</i> switch to ON. This bypasses the normal stow control sequences and causes the assembly to be driven inside the payload bay.
</ul>
