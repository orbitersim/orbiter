# Tracy profiler integration
#
# The profiler is split in 2 parts:
#    - client code that needs to be added to the process to profile
#    - server process that handles aggregating amd displaying the profiling data.
#
# Since Orbiter uses multiple DLLs, we must use a shared library for the client code.
# This TracyClient library must be added as dependency to DLLs wanting to use the profiler.
#
# When profiling is disabled, we don't build the server nor the client library.
# However we still need the Tracy.hpp file in the include path (tracy macros will be nop-ed).
#
# We build the server ourselves to make sure the version is compatible with the client.
#
# The default behavior makes the installation step copy files in bin/include/lib/cmake directories.
# We don't want that so with use EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL and then manually install the files where needed.
#
# The profiler is meant for the Orbiter core and possibly for in tree modules, but not external plugins,
# so we don't add the dependencies in the Orbiter SDK.
