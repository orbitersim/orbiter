<h1>Menu and infobar configuration</h1>

<p>The behaviour of the Orbiter main menu and the info blocks can be configured with the menu configuration dialog.
To open the dialog, right-click on the main menu with the mouse.
(If the main menu is hidden, you can display it by pressing <kbd class="ctrl">F4</kbd>).</p>

<h2>Menu bar</h2>
<p>You can select to show, hide or auto-hide the menu bar.
When auto-hidden, the menu will scroll into view when you move the mouse to the top edge of the simulation window.
If the menu is hidden, it can be displayed again by pressing <kbd class="ctrl">F4</kbd>.</p>
<p>You can also adjust the opacity of the menu background, and whether to display the menu icons or labels only.</p>

<h2>Info bars</h2>
<p>The info bars are displays in the top left and right corners of the simulation window.
The left info block shows the current camera target, camera mode, field of view and distance to target.
The right info block shows date (ephemeris date and MJD day number), simulation run time and current time accelartion setting.</p>
<p>The configuration dialog offers some configuration options for the info blocks, including the show/hide/auto-hide setting.</p>

<h2>Auxiliary info bars</h2>
<p>Optional info blocks can be attached to the left and right info bars. These include a frame rate monitor,
data on the current graphics load, and viewport parameters.</p>

<h2>Action indicator</h2>
<p>Select the way actions (pause, resume, record, playback) are indicated on screen. The indicator can be set to flash briefly on an action,
 to permanently display on pause/record/playback, or not to show at all.</p>
