<h1>Camera target</h1>
<p>Select the <i>Target</i> tab in the camera dialog to point the viewport camera to a new target. You can either select an object from the list, or type the name of the target in the text box above the object list, and click <i>Apply</i>. The target will jump to the selected object and show it in an <i>external</i> view. You may have to pan the camera in or out (with <kbd class="ctrl">PgUp</kbd><sub><i>cursor</i></sub> and <kbd class="ctrl">PgDn</kbd><sub><i>cursor</i></sub>) to bring the object within visual range.</p>

<p><b>Remember</b>: Changing the camera target has no influence on the <i>focus vessel</i> (the spacecraft you are currently controlling with the keyboard or joystick). You can always jump back to the focus object by pressing <kbd class="ctrl">F1</kbd>. <kbd class="ctrl">F1</kbd> also switches between internal (cockpit) and external view of the focus object (only the focus object allows to
switch to internal view). Alternatively, you can use the two buttons <i>Focus Cockpit</i> and <i>Focus Extern</i> at the bottom of the <i>Target</i> page to jump back to the focus object.</p>
