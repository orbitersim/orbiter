<h1>Vessel callback functions</h1>
<p>The following callback functions in a Vessel script are called by the
<a href="ScriptVessel.htm">ScriptVessel</a> module to allow the vessel script to respond
to various vessel events. A vessel script only needs to implement the callback
functions it wants to respond to. Callback functions that are not implemented
by the script revert to a default behaviour (usually nothing). However, some
callback functions (e.g. clbk_setclasscaps) should always be defined, because
they do not have a meaningful default behaviour.</p>
<p>The callback functions are case-sensitive. The arguments and return values must match the
format in the following list.</p>

<table class="summary">
<tr>
<td><a href="#clbk_setclasscaps">clbk_setclasscaps</a></td>
<td>Called during vessel creation to set physical parameters, load meshes, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="#clbk_postcreation">clbk_postcreation</a></td>
<td>Called after scenario has been defined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="#clbk_prestep">clbk_prestep</a></td>
<td>Per-frame processing at the beginning of a time step.</td>

<tr>
<td><a href="#clbk_poststep">clbk_poststep</a></td>
<td>Per-frame processing at the end of a time step.</td>

<div class="func_block">

<div class="func"><a name="clbk_setclasscaps"></a>
<h3>clbk_setclasscaps(cfg)</h3>
<p>Called during vessel creation to set physical parameters, load meshes, etc.</p>

<h4>Parameters:</h4>
<table>
<tr><td>cfg&nbsp;(file handle):</td><td>vessel configuration file handle</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Notes:</h4>
<p>This function is called after Orbiter has created an instance of the vessel
class, but before its state is defined. It should be implemented to set general
physical vessel parameters (empty mass, fuel capacity, engine layout and specs,
atmospheric parameters, etc.)
It is also a good place to load meshes, define animations, and performing similar
setup functions. It should not be used to set a specific vessel state (state
vectors, fuel level, etc.).</p>
</div>


<div class="func"><a name="clbk_postcreation"></a>
<h3>clbk_postcreation()</h3>
<p>Called after scenario has been defined.</p>

<h4>Notes:</h4>
<p>This function is called after the vessel state has been defined and just before
the vessel enters the simulation update cycle.</p>
<p>For vessels created at the start of the simulation session, it is called
after all other vessels have been created and defined. It is therefore a good place to
perform any functions that define the interaction between vessels.</p>
</div>


<div class="func"><a name="clbk_prestep"></a>
<h3>clbk_prestep(simt,simdt,mjd)</h3>
<p>Per-frame processing at the beginning of a time step.</p>

<h4>Parameters:</h4>
<table>
<tr><td>simt&nbsp;(number):</td><td>current simulation time [s]</td></tr>
<tr><td>simdt&nbsp;(number):</td><td>current step length [s]</td></tr>
<tr><td>mjd&nbsp;(number):</td><td>current absolute simulation time in MJD format [days]</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Notes:</h4>
<p>This function is called at the beginning of each time step to allow
the vessel to perform continuous processing tasks, including processing of
physical parameters and animation updates.</p>
</div>


<div class="func"><a name="clbk_poststep"></a>
<h3>clbk_poststep(simt,simdt,mjd)</h3>
<p>Per-frame processing at the end of a time step.</p>

<h4>Parameters:</h4>
<table>
<tr><td>simt&nbsp;(number):</td><td>current simulation time [s]</td></tr>
<tr><td>simdt&nbsp;(number):</td><td>current step length [s]</td></tr>
<tr><td>mjd&nbsp;(number):</td><td>current absolute simulation time in MJD format [days]</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Notes:</h4>
<p>This function is called at the end of each time step to allow
the vessel to perform continuous processing tasks, including processing of
physical parameters and animation updates.</p>
