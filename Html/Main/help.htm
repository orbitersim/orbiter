<h1>How to use Help</h1>
<p>
This help window can be opened from the Orbiter Launchpad dialog by pressing the "Help" button, or during a simulation by pressing <kbd class="ctrl">Alt</kbd> <kbd class="ctrl">F1</kbd>, or selecting "Help" from the main menu (<kbd class="ctrl">F4</kbd>).
<p>
You can close the window by clicking the "X" button in the top right corner.
<p>
Double-clicking in the title bar will minimise the window. This feature keeps help at your fingertips without cluttering the 3-D simulation window. (The same trick also works for all other in-game dialog boxes.)
<p>
You can navigate the help system with the contents, index and search facilities on the left side of the help window (This area can be displayed or hidden by pressing the ("Show" or "Hide" button in the navigation bar at the top.)
<p>
Some scenarios come with context-sensitive help pages, which can be accessed by pressing the "Scenario" button in the navigation bar, if it is shown.
<p>
If the spacecraft you are currently controlling provides a help file, it can be accessed by pressing the "Vessel" button in the navigation bar.
