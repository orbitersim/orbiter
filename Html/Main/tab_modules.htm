<h1>Plugin modules</h1>
<p>
This tab allows to activate and deactivate plugin modules for Orbiter which can extend the functionality of the core simulator. Plugins can contain additional instruments, dialogs, interfaces to external programs, etc. Make sure you only activate modules you actually want to use, because modules can take up some processing time even if they run in the background, and thus affect Orbiter's performance.</p>
<p>
The modules provided with the standard Orbiter distribution are demos from the SDK package, and are available in full source code. A wide variety of additional modules by 3rd party add-on developers can be downloaded from Orbiter repositories on the internet.</p>
<p>
Some of the standard modules distributed with Orbiter are:</p>
<p>
<a href="ms-its:html/plugin/ScnEditor.chm::/ScnEditor.htm"><b>Scenario Editor</b></a>: Allows to create, configure and delete vessels during a simulation.</p>
<p>
<b>transx</b>: Duncan Sharpe's interplanetary Trans-X MFD with many improvements over the built-in transfer MFD mode.</p>
<p>
<b>LuaConsole</b>: Command console support. Allows to open a console window from the <i>Custom Functions</i> list. For details on the script interface, see the <a href="Script/ScriptRef.htm">Orbiter Scripting</a> manual.</p>
<p>
<b>LuaMFD</b>: Terminal MFD support. Provides a new <i>Terminal</i> MFD mode that can be selected from the MFD mode selection list. Allows to enter commands similar to the Console window.</p>
<p>
<b>Rcontrol</b>: Remote control of ship engines. This allows to manipulate vessels even if they don't have input focus. If this module is active, the remote control window can be selected from the <i>Custom Functions</i> list.</p>
<p>
<b>FlightData</b>: Real-time atmospheric flight data telemetry. If this module is active, the flight data window can be selected from the <i>Custom Functions</i> list.</p>
<p>
<b>Framerate</b>: A graphical simulation frame rate (FPS) display. If this module is active, the frame rate window can be selected from the <i>Custom Functions</i> list.</p>
