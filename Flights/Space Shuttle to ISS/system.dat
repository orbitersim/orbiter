1 NOTE Welcome! You are in command of Space Shuttle Atlantis to fly a resupply mission to the International Space Station.
10 NOTE Atlantis is ready on pad LC39B of Kennedy Space Center. T-80 seconds and counting.

19 NOTE This flight is pre-recorded, but I will explain the procedures and the use of the autopilot, so you can fly your own mission later.
28 NOTE The left MFD has been set to the Shuttle ascent autopilot interface mode (AscentAP), where you can set the launch parameters.

37 NOTE You can adjust the launch azimuth angle by pressing the AZ- and AZ+ buttons.
46 NOTE You can adjust the launch azimuth angle by pressing the AZ- and AZ+ buttons.    The launch azimuth is the initial heading the Shuttle will follow after launch. It governs the inclination of the orbit you enter.
55 NOTE You want to intercept the International Space Station orbiting at an inclination of 51.6Â° on the descending section of its orbit, and the launch azimuth has already been set up accordingly for a SE launch.
64 NOTE You can adjust the altitude of the target orbit with the AL- and AL+ buttons.
73 NOTE You can adjust the altitude of the target orbit with the AL- and AL+ buttons.    This has also been adjusted to approximately match the ISS altitude at 350km.
82 NOTE Pressing the L button will initiate the launch sequence. (In this tutorial, this will be done automatically.)

118.9 NOTE On the MAP MFD display, it can be seen that the Shuttle's launch location at Cape Canaveral, Florida, is just about to pass underneath the ISS's orbital plane (symbolised by the yellow line).
128 NOTE This event marks the launch window - it allows the shuttle to launch into the same orbital plane without the need for fuel-expensive plane changes later on.
137 NOTE In fact, if you look closely, the ISS's orbital plane is still slightly east of the launch position. This is because during ascent, the shuttle's eastward compoent of its tangential velocity is still below its eventual orbital velocity, meaning that the ISS will continue to gain on the shuttle position.
149 NOTE Note how, as it pitches over and starts to accumulate a horizontal velocity component, the shuttle's orbital plane (indicated by the green line) is slowly rotating to match the ISS's plane.

3160 NOTE In preparation for the next maneuvers we need to set up the instruments.
3170 NOTE First, switch the head-up display (HUD) to Orbit mode, by pressing "H" twice.
3180 NOTE In Orbit mode, the HUD displays a pitch ladder with respect to the orbital plane, and a yaw tape that shows the angle to the orbital velocity vector (the prograde direction).
3190 NOTE The next task is to fine-tune the orbital plane to match that of the ISS.
3200 NOTE This will require a velocity change (Delta-V) normal (perpendicular) to the orbital plane, executed at the intersection (node) of current and target planes.

3210 NOTE This type of plane change is assisted by the "Align planes" MFD mode.    On the left MFD, Click <SEL>, <Align planes>.
3220 NOTE Next, pick the target object. Click <TGT>, press Enter, type "iss", press Enter.
3230 NOTE The display shows the current orbital position (P) in relation to the descending (DN) and ascending node (AN) defining the line of nodes (the yellow line) with the target plane.
3240 NOTE Other useful readout values are the relative inclination between the planes (RInc), the rate of change (Rate), the time to node (Tn) and the estimated burn times (TthA, TthD) for matching the planes, at ascending and descending node, respectively.
3250 NOTEPOS 0.65 0.25 0.98 0.9
3250 NOTE The plane change will require a burn normal to the orbital plane, so we need to orient the orbiter correspondingly.
3260 NOTE An additional problem is the fact that on the Shuttle, the OMS engines are tilted by about 15 degrees against the longitudinal axis.    This must be taken into account when rotating the orbiter.
3270 NOTE The "Attitude RCS" MFD mode can assist here.    On the right MFD, click <SEL>, <Attitude RCS>.
3280 NOTE Click <SET>, followed by <BAS>, to switch the base attitude mode to "Normal".
3290 NOTE Click <+R> to add a pitch rotation to the base mode. Now click <+V> repeatedly until the rotation angle is set at +15 degrees.

3403 NOTE The position of the prograde burn will become the perigee location of the orbit.
3413 NOTE The perigee location will also be the designated rendezvous point with the ISS.
3423 NOTE Since the current orbit is approximately circular, the perigee is not yet well defined. The next burn can be initiated anywhere along the orbital trajectory.
3433 NOTE However, we will delay the burn until we emerge from the Earth's shadow. This will ensure that the eventual rendezvous and docking manoever can take place in daylight.

5515 NOTE The arrival time list on the right side of the Sync Orbit MFD shows the time to rendezvous point of your spacecraft (Sh-ToR) and the target craft (Tg-ToR) for a sequence of orbits, where "0" refers to the current orbit.
5525 NOTE The pair of entries indicated in yellow represents the closest match of arrival times between you and the target.
5535 NOTE As your orbit period increases during the prograde burn, this will eventually jump to the end of the list, and then start moving up the list.
5545 NOTE The earliear you want the rendezvous to take place, the longer you will need to burn (and the longer you will need to decelerate at rendezvous to match orbits).
5555 NOTE Thus, there is a tradeoff between rendezvous time and fuel expenditure.    If you are short on fuel, you can target a later orbit for rendezvous.
5565 NOTE In this instance, we are planning for rendezvous in orbit 5.
