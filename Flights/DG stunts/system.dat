206.93 NOTE This will open the editor window containing a list of recorded events (which may be empty at the start).
218 NOTE If you want to insert an event at some point during the playback, pause the simulation (Ctrl-P), select an event type from the pulldown list in the editor window, and press 'Insert'.
229.075 NOTE Next, edit any event parameters to your preferences.
239.089 CAMERA SET Track:GL-01:10.00:GLOBAL 54.207 -0.654 -0.575
