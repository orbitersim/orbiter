95 NOTE We want to launch into the orbital plane of the Moon to minimise the need for expensive plane changes later on.
105 NOTE Look at the map on the right MFD display. The green cross over Florida labelled 'GL-01' represents your current position. The green curve represents the projection of your orbital plane onto the surface, the red curve that of the Moon.
120 NOTE The Moon's plane of orbit slowly moves across the map display because the Earth is rotating under it. As soon as it approaches your current location, you will take off.
135 NOTE Because the northern latitude of your location is slightly higher than the inclination of the Moon's orbit, the optimal launch time is the instant when the northernmost point of the Moon's orbit plane is just south of Florida (launching due east).
150 NOTE For launch sites closer to the equator, it is best to launch when the Moon's orbit plane crosses the site. Launch heading is then North-east or South-east, to match the orbital plane.

17020 NOTE Bring up the Transfer MFD mode on the left display: Press 'SEL' and 'Transfer'.
17035 NOTE First, you need to select the target body. Press 'TGT', <Enter>, type 'moon', <Enter>.
17055 NOTE To plan your transfer orbit, press 'HTO' (hypothetical transfer orbit).
17065 NOTE Next, you need to add a Delta-V impulse at your orbit ejection point. Press, and hold down, 'DV+', until the 'Dv' readout shows 3.121k (meaning 3.121km/s). If you overshoot, press 'DV-' to reduce the ejection velocity.
17125 NOTE Your planned transfer orbit should now be displayed as a dashed green ellipse. The leading intersection with the Moon's orbit (the yellow circle) is shown as a grey line.
17145 NOTE The predicted position of the Moon at the time when you cross the Moon's orbit, is shown as a dashed yellow line.
17160 NOTE You now have to try and match the grey and the dashed yellow lines, so that both you and the Moon reach the intersection point simultaneously.
17175 NOTE This is done by adjusting the time of the ejection burn, using the 'EJ-' and 'EJ+' buttons.
17190 NOTE Press 'EJ-' and 'EJ+' until the lines match. The 'TLe' readout should read approximately 11°.

283309 NOTE Because we want to land directly at Brighton Beach base, we need to rotate the plane of our lunar orbit so that it passes over the base. This plane change requires less Delta-V (and thus less fuel) while we are still far from the moon, so let's do it now.
283324 NOTE Switch the left MFD to Map mode: Click 'SEL', 'Map', click 'REF', and select 'Earth' > 'Moon'.

283364 NOTE The green line is the projection of the current orbital plane onto the moon's surface. We want to rotate the plane so that it crosses over the target base. 
283379 NOTE To line up the glider for the alignment burn, we activate the 'Normal+' navigation mode.
283394 NOTE (Why NML+? We are orbiting the Moon retrograde. The flight path vector points west. This also means that the NML+ direction points south. By adding Delta-V in this direction, we will bend the western part of the orbit south, the eastern part north.)
283414 NOTE Engaging 'Normal+' attitude mode to prepare for a plane-change burn.
283454 NOTE As the main engines fire, the orbit bends out of the moon's equatorial plane, until it intersects the target base.
283480 NOTE Done. Note that the the alignment will not remain perfect, because the Moon (and the base with it) slowly rotates below our orbit. But this can easily be fixed later with a correction burn.

283495 NOTE With the orbital plane aligned, the next step is to adjust the periapsis (or in this case, the perilune) distance, that is, the point of closest approach to the Moon.
283510 NOTE Currently, the orbit is intersecting the Moon's surface, so we need to raise the periapsis altitude (PeA) above zero.
283525 NOTE This is an in-plane burn. Since we are not at periapsis, I am using a wild guess for a reasonable burn direction - 50° off the flight path.

307740 NOTE With the current fuel load, the main engines can produce an acceleration of about a = 20m/s². Orbital speed is about 1600m/s.
