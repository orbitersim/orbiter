/*     Include Section:  EK Encoded Query Internal Parameters */

/*        ekquery.inc  Version 3    16-NOV-1995 (NJB) */

/*           Updated to reflect increased value of MAXCON in */
/*           ekqlimit.inc. */

/*        ekquery.inc  Version 2    03-AUG-1995 (NJB) */

/*           Updated to support representation of the SELECT clause. */


/*        ekquery.inc  Version 1    12-JAN-1995 (NJB) */


/*     An encoded EK query is an abstract data type implemented */
/*     as an integer cell, along with a double precision cell and */
/*     a character string.  The d.p. cell and string contain numeric */
/*     and string values from the query string represented by the */
/*     encoded query. */

/*     The parameters in this file are intended for use only by the */
/*     EK encoded query access routines.  Callers of EK routines should */
/*     not use these parameters. */

/*     The following parameters are indices of specified elements */
/*     in the integer portion of the encoded query. */

/*     Encoded query architecture type: */


/*     `Name resolution' consists of: */

/*        - Verifying existence of tables:  any table names listed */
/*          in the FROM clause of a query must be loaded. */

/*        - Validating table aliases used to qualify column names. */

/*        - Verifying existence of columns and obtaining data types */
/*          for columns. */

/*        - Setting data type codes for literal values in the encoded */
/*          query. */

/*        - Checking consistency of operators and operand data types. */

/*        - Making sure unqualified column names are unambiguous. */

/*        - For constraints, mapping the table names used to qualify */
/*          column names to the ordinal position in the FROM clause */
/*          of the corresponding table. */


/*     Initialization status---this flag indicates whether the encoded */
/*     query has been initialized.  Values are ITRUE or IFALSE.  See the */
/*     include file ekbool.inc for parameter values. */


/*     Parse status---this flag indicates whether the parsing operation */
/*     that produced an encoded query has been completed. Values are */
/*     ITRUE or IFALSE. */


/*     Name resolution status---this flag indicates whether names */
/*     have been resolved in an encoded query.  Values are ITRUE or */
/*     IFALSE. */


/*     Time resolution status---this flag indicates whether time values */
/*     have been resolved in an encoded query.  Time resolution */
/*     consists of converting strings representing time values to ET. */
/*     Values of the status are ITRUE or IFALSE. */


/*     Semantic check status---this flag indicates whether semantic */
/*     checking of constraints has been performed. */


/*     Number of tables specified in FROM clause: */


/*     Number of constraints in query: */


/*     A special value is used to indicate the `maximal' constraint--- */
/*     one that logically cannot be satisfied.  If the constraints */
/*     are equivalent to the maximal constraint, the location EQNCNS */
/*     is assigned the value EQMXML */


/*     Number of constraint conjunctions: */


/*     Number of order-by columns: */


/*     Number of SELECT columns: */


/*     Size of double precision buffer: */


/*     `Free' pointer into double precision buffer: */


/*     Size of character string buffer: */


/*     `Free' pointer into character string buffer: */


/*     The following four base pointers will be valid after a query */
/*     has been parsed: */

/*     Base pointer for SELECT column descriptors: */


/*     Base pointer for constraint descriptors: */


/*     Base pointer for conjunction sizes: */


/*     Base pointer for order-by column descriptors: */


/*     After the quantities named above, the integer array contains */
/*     series of descriptors for tables, constraints, and order-by */
/*     columns, as well as a list of `conjunction sizes'---that is, */
/*     the sizes of the groups of constraints that form conjunctions, */
/*     after the input query has been re-arranged as a disjunction of */
/*     conjunctions of constraints. */


/*     The offsets of specific elements within descriptors are */
/*     parameterized. The base addresses of the descriptors themselves */
/*     must be  calculated using the counts and sizes of the items */
/*     preceding them. */

/*     A diagram of the structure of the variable-size portion of the */
/*     integer array is shown below: */


/*        +-------------------------------------+ */
/*        | Fixed-size portion of encoded query | */
/*        +-------------------------------------+ */
/*        |         Encoded FROM clause         | */
/*        +-------------------------------------+ */
/*        |      Encoded constraint clause      | */
/*        +-------------------------------------+ */
/*        |          Conjunction sizes          | */
/*        +-------------------------------------+ */
/*        |       Encoded ORDER BY clause       | */
/*        +-------------------------------------+ */
/*        |        Encoded SELECT clause        | */
/*        +-------------------------------------+ */


/*     Value Descriptors */
/*     ---------------- */

/*     In order to discuss the various descriptors below, we'll make use */
/*     of sub-structures called `value descriptors'.  These descriptors */
/*     come in two flavors:  character and double precision.  For */
/*     strings, a descriptor is a set of begin and end pointers that */
/*     indicate the location of the string in the character portion of an */
/*     encoded query, along with the begin and end pointers for the */
/*     corresponding lexeme in the original query.  The pointers are set */
/*     to zero when they are not in use, for example if they refer to an */
/*     optional lexeme that did not appear in the input query. */

/*     All value descriptors start with a data type indicator; values */
/*     are from ektype.inc.  Integer and time values are referred to */
/*     by double precision descriptors. */

/*     Parameters for string value descriptor elements: */


/*     Numeric value descriptors are similar to those for string values, */
/*     the difference being that they have only one pointer to the value */
/*     they represent.  This pointer is the index of the value in the */
/*     encoded query's numeric buffer. */


/*     All value descriptors have the same size.  In order to allow */
/*     table descriptors to have the same size as value descriptors, */
/*     we include an extra element in the descriptor. */


/*     Column Descriptors */
/*     ----------------- */

/*     Each column descriptor consists of a character descriptor for the */
/*     name of the column, followed by an index, which gives the ordinal */
/*     position of the column in the logical table to which the column */
/*     belongs.  The index element is filled in during name resolution. */


/*     Table Descriptors */
/*     ----------------- */

/*     Each table descriptor consists of a character descriptor for the */
/*     name of the table, followed by an index, which gives the ordinal */
/*     position of the table in the FROM clause in the original query. */
/*     The index element is filled in during name resolution.  Aliases */
/*     and table names have identical descriptor structures. */


/*     Constraint descriptors */
/*     ------------------ */

/*     Each constraint is characterized by: */

/*        - A code indicating whether the constraint compares values */
/*          in two columns or the value in a column and a literal */
/*          value.  The values of this element are EQCOL and EQVAL. */



/*        - A descriptor for the table used to qualify the */
/*          column name on the left side of the constraint. */


/*        - A character value descriptor for the column name on the left */
/*          side of the query. */


/*        - An operator code indicating the relational operator used */
/*          in the constraint. */


/*        If the constraint compares values from two columns, the */
/*        next items are table and column name descriptors that apply to */
/*        the column named on the right side of the relational operator. */


/*        If the constraint has a literal value on the right side, the */
/*        operator code is followed by... */

/*        - a value descriptor. */


/*        - Size of a constraint descriptor: */


/*     Conjunction sizes */
/*     ----------------- */

/*     The size of each conjunction of constraints occupies a single */
/*     integer. */




/*     Order-by Column Descriptors */
/*     --------------------------- */

/*     Each order-by column descriptor contains descriptors for */
/*     the table containing the column and for the name of the column */
/*     itself; one additional element is used to indicate the direction */
/*     of the ordering (ascending vs descending). */


/*        - The last integer in the descriptor indicates whether the */
/*          order direction is ascending or descending. */


/*        - Size of an order-by column descriptor: */


/*     Codes indicating sense of ordering (ascending vs descending): */


/*     SELECT Column Descriptors */
/*     --------------------------- */

/*     Each SELECT column descriptor contains descriptors for */
/*     the table containing the column and for the name of the column */
/*     itself. */


/*        - Size of a SELECT column descriptor: */


/*     Miscellaneous parameters: */


/*     EQIMIN is the minimum size of the integer portion of */
/*     an encoded query.  EQIMIN depends on the parameters */

/*        MAXTAB */
/*        MAXCON */
/*        MAXORD */
/*        MAXSEL */

/*     all of which are declared in the include file ekqlimit.inc. */
/*     The functional definition of EQIMIN is: */

/*     INTEGER               EQIMIN */
/*     PARAMETER           ( EQIMIN =   EQVBAS */
/*    .                              +  MAXTAB * EQVDSZ * 2 */
/*    .                              +  MAXCON * EQCDSZ */
/*    .                              +  MAXCON */
/*    .                              +  MAXORD * EQODSZ */
/*    .                              +  MAXSEL * EQSDSZ     ) */
