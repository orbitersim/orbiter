/*     Note:  The column descriptor size parameter CDSCSZ  is */
/*     declared separately in the include section CDSIZE$INC.FOR. */

/*     Offset of column descriptors, relative to start of segment */
/*     integer address range.  This number, when added to the last */
/*     integer address preceding the segment, yields the DAS integer */
/*     base address of the first column descriptor.  Currently, this */
/*     offset is exactly the size of a segment descriptor.  The */
/*     parameter SDSCSZ, which defines the size of a segment descriptor, */
/*     is declared in the include file eksegdsc.inc. */


/*     Size of column descriptor */


/*     Indices of various pieces of column descriptors: */


/*     CLSIDX is the index of the column's class code.  (We use the */
/*     word `class' to distinguish this item from the column's data */
/*     type.) */


/*     TYPIDX is the index of the column's data type code (CHR, INT, DP, */
/*     or TIME).  The type is actually implied by the class, but it */
/*     will frequently be convenient to look up the type directly. */



/*     LENIDX is the index of the column's string length value, if the */
/*     column has character type.  A value of IFALSE in this element of */
/*     the descriptor indicates that the strings have variable length. */


/*     SIZIDX is the index of the column's element size value.  This */
/*     descriptor element is meaningful for columns with fixed-size */
/*     entries.  For variable-sized columns, this value is IFALSE. */


/*     NAMIDX is the index of the base address of the column's name. */


/*     IXTIDX is the data type of the column's index.  IXTIDX */
/*     contains a type value only if the column is indexed. For columns */
/*     that are not indexed, the location IXTIDX contains the boolean */
/*     value IFALSE. */


/*     IXPIDX is a pointer to the column's index.  IXTPDX contains a */
/*     meaningful value only if the column is indexed.  The */
/*     interpretation of the pointer depends on the data type of the */
/*     index. */


/*     NFLIDX is the index of a flag indicating whether nulls are */
/*     permitted in the column.  The value at location NFLIDX is */
/*     ITRUE if nulls are permitted and IFALSE otherwise. */


/*     ORDIDX is the index of the column's ordinal position in the */
/*     list of columns belonging to the column's parent segment. */


/*     METIDX is the index of the column's integer metadata pointer. */
/*     This pointer is a DAS integer address. */
