<p>The Docking MFD assists during final approach to dock with another vessel or orbital station. It provides indicators for translational and rotational alignment with the approach path, as well as distance and closing speed readouts.

This instrument relies on docking approach data received by your spacecraft. Approach data can be acquired in three different modes:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>IDS mode: data are acquired from a radio signal sent by the docking target. The IDS (In­strument Docking System) signal is obtained by tuning a NAV receiver to the appropriate frequency and slaving the Docking MFD to that receiver. The typical range for IDS is ~100km. To select a NAV receiver, press <kbd class="ctrl">Shift</kbd> <kbd>N</kbd>. The selected frequency is displayed in the upper right corner of the MFD.</li>
<li>Visual  mode: Docking parameters are acquired from onboard visual systems (typically video cameras mounted in the docking port. The visual system aids in docking to targets which don't provide IDS. The typical range for visual mode is ~100m. To switch to visual mode, press <kdb class="ctrl">Shift</kbd> <kbd>V</kbd>.</li>
<li>Direct target selection: If you want to avoid the need to tune into a navigation transmitter signal, you can open target dialog ( <kbd class="ctrl">Shift</kbd> <kbd>T</kbd> ) and enter target name (and optional docking port index &ge; 1) directly. (This shortcut method may be dropped in a future version).</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Apart from their different operational range, the three modes provide are identical in terms of the produced MFD display.</p>
