<h1>Selecting a spacecraft</h1>

<p>Apart from the spacecraft you are controlling during an Orbiter simulation, there may be a number of other vessels present in the scenario. You can jump into a different vessel at any time of the simulation session.</p>

<p>To do so, press <kbd class="ctrl">F3</kbd>. This brings up a dialog of all the vessels in the current scenario that can be controlled manually.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Some vessels may not be listed in the dialog box. These are usually objects that do not have any thrust or attitude components that can be manually controlled.</p>

<p>If the list is too long, you can restrict it to vessels in the vicinity of the current camera position, or organize it according to planets or spacecraft types by selecting the <i>Nearby</i>, <i>Location</i> or <i>Class</i> tabs.</p>

<p>In the <i>Nearby</i> list, you can define the search radius by moving the <i>Range</i> slider.</p>

<p>You can also switch the list view between <i>flat</i> and <i>hierarchical</i> mode. In the latter, docked and attached assemblies of spacecraft are grouped together.</p>

<p>Select an object from the list, and click <i>Apply</i>. This will put you in control of that vessel. All keyboard, mouse and joystick input will be directed to the new vessel, while your previous vessel will no longer receive manual control commands.</p>

<h2>Previous vessel</h2>

<p>Click the <i>Previous</i> button to jump back into the previously selected spacecraft. You can also do this with the keyboard shortcut <kbd class="ctrl">Ctrl</kbd> <kbd class="ctrl">F3</kbd> without having to open the dialog.</p>

<p>You can use <kbd class="ctrl">Ctrl</kbd> <kbd class="ctrl">F3</kbd> repeatedly to switch backwards and forwards between your last two vessels.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Selecting a vessel is different from selecting a <a href ="cam_target.htm">camera target</a>. If you are pointing the camera to a new object, you will still be in control of the same spacecraft (even if you can't see it anymore). You can always jump back into the cockpit of the craft you are flying by pressing <kbd class="ctrl">F1</kbd>.</p>
