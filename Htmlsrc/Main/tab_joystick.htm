<h1>Joystick settings</h1>
<p>
If a joystick is connected to your computer, you can use it to control your spacecraft in orbiter. The Joystick page provides some configuration options. Other joystick-related tasks, such as calibrating the axes or programming joystick button functions, can usually be carried out with driver utilities provided by Windows or the joystick software.</p>

<h2>Joystick device</h2>
<p>
Select a joystick from the list, or click "&lt;disabled&gt;" to force Orbiter to ignore your joystick.</p>

<h2>Main engine control</h2>
<p>
Define the joystick axis which controls the main thrusters. Try different options if the throttle control on your joystick doesn't work in Orbiter.</p>
<p>
<b>Ignore throttle setting on launch</b>: If ticked, the joystick throttle will be ignored at the launch of a scenario until the user manipulates it. Otherwise, the throttle setting is used immediately.</p>

<h2>Calibration</h2>
<p>
<b>Deadzone</b>: Use this to define how soon the joystick will respond when moved out of its centre position. Smaller values make it respond sooner. Increase if attitude thrusters do not cut out completely in neutral position.</p>
<p>
<b>Throttle saturation</b>: Defines the tolerance zone at the minimum and maximum range of the throttle control at which the joystick reports zero and maximum throttle, respectively. Reduce if main engines do not cut out completely at minimum throttle setting.  (Applies only to joy­sticks with throttle control).</p>
