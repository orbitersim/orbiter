<h1>Camera ground mode</h1>

<p>Use the <i>Ground</i> tab in the camera dialog to select a ground-based camera mode. Ground-based views place the camera at a fixed point relative to the surface of a planet. This is a good way to follow the launch of a rocket from a spectator's perspective, or view the final approach of a Shuttle from the control tower.</p>

<p>You can select a ground view either by picking one of the predefined positions under the <i>Ground observer location</i> field, defined by a <i>celestial body</i>, a <i>location</i> and a <i>viewpoint</i>, and clicking the <i>Apply</i> button. Note that predefined ground locations may not be available for all celestial bodies.</p>

<p>Or you can simply click the <i>Current</i> button. This maintains the current camera location, but switches to ground observer mode.</p>

<p>There are two different operation modes for the ground observer camera: If the <i>Target lock</i> option is ticked, the camera will always be pointed towards the current camera target. You can move the camera around the target, and move in or out, but the target remains in the centre of the simulation window.</p>

<p>If the target lock option is not ticked, the camera is in <i>free</i> mode. In this case, it can be both moved and rotated independent of the view target.</p>

<p>In both modes, the speed of movement can be changed by adjusting the <i>Panning speed</i> slider.</p>

<p>The ground-relative camera position and direction data are displayed in the <i>Position/Direction</i> field.</p>
