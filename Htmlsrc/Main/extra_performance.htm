<h1>Performance settings</h1>
<p>This option can be used to modify Windows environment parameters that can improve the simulator performance.</p>

<h2>Disable font smoothing while Orbiter is running</h2>
<p>Font smoothing provides better text display in MFD instruments, but can seriously degrade performance on some computers.
Disable font smoothing if you are experiencing performance issues, such as periodic stutters.</p>
<p>Font smoothing is a system-wide property, so other applications will also change their font display when this option is active.
Orbiter automatically restores font smoothing on closing.</p>

<h2>Enforce font smoothing on exit</h2>
<p>Usually, Orbiter restores the original font smoothing setting on exit. However, in case of a program crash font smoothing may not be restored correctly. Ticking this option enforces font smoothing on exit, even if it wasn't active when Orbiter was launched. This can help recovering the smoothing setting if it was lost by a previous crash.</p>
