<h1>Mission 2: ISS to Mir transfer</h1>
<p>
This mission performs an orbital transfer from the International Space Station to the Russian Mir station (which in Orbiter's virtual reality is still happily in Earth orbit). Note that in Orbiter, Mir is placed in an ecliptic orbit to make it a platform for interplanetary missions. This means that ISS and Mir have a very high relative inclination which makes the transfer very expensive in terms of fuel expenditure.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Start Orbiter with the <i>Checklists|ISS to Mir</i> scenario. Your glider is docked to the ISS.
<li>Press <kbd class="ctrl">F1</kbd> to jump into the glider's cockpit.
<li>Select target Mir in Orbit MFD: Press Right-<kbd class="ctrl">Shift</kbd> <kbd>T</kbd>, <kbd class="ctrl">Enter</kbd>, "Mir".
<li>ISS and Mir orbits have a high relative inclination. To prepare for orbit change, select the Align plane mode in the left MFD (<i>SEL</i>, <i>Align planes</i>, and Left-<kbd class="ctrl">Shift</kbd> <kbd>T</kbd>, "Mir").
<li>Undock from the ISS (&nbsp;<kbd class="ctrl">Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd>&nbsp;). Once you are clear of the dock, close the nose cone (&nbsp;<kbd>K</kbd>&nbsp;).
<li>Switch to Orbit HUD mode (&nbsp;<kbd>H</kbd>&nbsp;).
<li>The first burn will take place at the DN (descending node) point. Use time compression to fast-forward there, but switch back to real-time when the "time-to-node" (Tn) value in the Align plane MFD is down to 500.
<li>Prepare attitude for the burn: click the "Orbit normal (+)" button. Your glider will now orient itself perpendicular to the orbital plane.
<li>When the "Engage engines" indicator in the Align MFD begins to flash, engage full main engines. The relative orbit inclination (RInc) should start to drop. Terminate the burn when the "Kill thrust" indicator appears and the inclination reaches its minimum.
<li>This is a very long burn (about 900 seconds), so you may want to fast-forward, but do not miss the end of the burn!
<li>You probably won't be able to sufficiently reduce the inclination (less than 0.5 degrees) in a single burn. Repeat the process at the AN (ascending node) point. Remember that the glider must be oriented in the opposite direction for this burn, by clicking the "Orbit Normal (-)" button.
<li>Once the orbital planes are aligned, you need to plot a rendezvous trajectory using the Sync Orbit MFD. The procedure is the same as in Mission 1.
<li>Tune your NAV1 receiver to MIR's transponder frequency at 132.10, and NAV2 to the IDS frequency of Dock 1 at 135.00.
<li>Once the sync manoeuvre is complete, switch the HUD to Docking mode (&nbsp;<kbd>H</kbd>, <kbd>H</kbd>&nbsp;), and switch one of the MFD displays to Docking (<i>SEL</i>, <i>Docking</i>). Slave both HUD and MFD to NAV1.
<li>Proceed with the docking manoeuvre to Mir in the same way as you did for docking at the ISS in Mission 1. Don't forget to open the nose cone before making contact.
</li>
